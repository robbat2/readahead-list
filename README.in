This implementation of a client for readhead was written by Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@orbis-terrarum.net>.

It is based on a version originally written by Erich Schubert <erich@debian.org>.
Which was found at:
http://blog.drinsama.de/erich/en/linux/2004121101-readahead.html 
(link to http://people.debian.org/~erich/readahead-list.c).

As Erich is a Debian developer, and his original source lacks any license, I've
specifically chosen GPL-2 as the license, as the code is based off the kernel
readahead.

This has mainly been developed in response to Gentoo Bug #64724
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64724

The application very specifically does NOT output any errors unless you have
--debug on. This is in case a file isn't on your system between boots.

Syntax:
readahead-list [OPTIONS] FILE [FILE...]

Where each FILE contains a list of items to perform readahead(2) on, one per
line.

OPTIONS:

--verbose
	Print the name of each file that is actually loaded.
--debug
	As the name says.
--version
	Should be obvious.
--help
	Stop looking at me!
