Here are a few scripts I hacked up to build a possible list of files to perform
readahead(2) on. 

There were written to parse a file, and descend into any possible script
WITHOUT executing the script or binary.

The set handling stuff is a major bottleneck, causing exponential slowdown :-(.

You should probably run these as root, or at least with all of your sbin
directories in your path.

For better logging, we need to look at either Linux accounting, or some form of
auditing system.

Sample usage:
./build-file-list.sh /sbin/rc > readahead._sbin_rc.list #(~15 seconds)
./grab-runlevel-execs.sh boot > readahead.runlevel-boot.list #(~80 seconds)
./grab-runlevel-execs.sh default > readahead.runlevel-default.list #(~4 minutes)
