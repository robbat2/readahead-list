Here are a few scripts I hacked up to build a possible list of files to perform
readahead(2) on. 

There were written to parse a file, and descend into any possible script
WITHOUT executing the script or binary.

The set handling stuff is a major bottleneck, causing exponential slowdown :-(.

For better logging, we need to look at either Linux accounting, or some form of
auditing system.
